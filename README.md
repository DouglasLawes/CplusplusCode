# CplusplusCode
This repository refers to my C++ coding courseworks as part of my degree, which can be provided upon request. See below for a brief description of their subject matter.


The first .zip file is the first of two courseworks in my most recent programming module during my master's degree, where I produced a 2D Finite Difference solver to answer specific questions given (cannot provide questions). I achieved 81% (strong first) on this coursework.

The second .zip file is the second of the two courseworks and was about producing a general and adaptable coding structure for numerical integration using quadrature. I achieved 85% (strong first) on this coursework.

The third .zip file is the first of two courseworks from a consequent module of a similar format where it was requested to be of a more casual nature, and hence notations are less strict, so is not a true indication of my coding formality. This assignment was about spline interpolation and root finding. I achieved 95% (extremely strong first) in this.

The final .zip file is the final of my C++ coding courseworks from the above informal set, which was about solving parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic PDE's in two and three dimensions. I achieved 89% (extremely strong first) in this.
